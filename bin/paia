=head1 DESCRIPTION

The paia command line client can be used to access library patron account
information, such as loans, reservations, and fees via the Patrons Account
Information API (PAIA). 

PAIA defines three commands for authentification (PAIA auth) and six commands
to access a patron account (PAIA core). Each command can be called as first
argument to the client. For instance

    paia items [options]

calls the "items" command of PAIA core. Access to PAIA core commands is granted
by access tokens that can be required by the "login" command. By default the
client automatically calls "login" if needed.

Basic options, such as base/core/auth URLs, username, and password can be stored
in a config file, such as following. By default C<paia.json> read used if found.

    {
      "base": "http://example.org/",
      "username": "alice",
      "password": "12345"
    }

Access token, patron identifier and PAIA server URLs are stored in a session
file (C<.paia_session> by default) that can be checked with command "session".

=head1 COMMANDS

Call C<< paia help <command> >> for help on a specific PAIA command. Note that
PAIA servers do not need to support all PAIA commands.
